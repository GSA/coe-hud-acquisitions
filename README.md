## GSA and HUD Issue RFIs for Centers of Excellence Phase II Work

The mission of the Centers of Excellence (CoE), housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

Currently, CoE is completing Phase I, the discovery and assessment work, being performed at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These efforts have resulted in six different but interrelated needs for four of our Centers. Those four Centers are Cloud Adoption, Contact Center, Customer Experience, and Data Analytics Centers. The six needs are:

* Cloud Adoption - Forms-as-a-Service, Electronic Records Management, and Intelligent Data Extraction
* Contact Center - HUDCentral Contact Center (potentially coming soon)
* Customer Experience - Build an Agency-Wide Customer Experience capability
* Data Analytics - Establish the OCDO and Data Governance
* Data Analytics - Advanced Analytics for OCDO
* Data Analytics - Data Visualization for OCDO

For each need, the CoE has issued an RFI and a draft RFQ, all of which can be found on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/GSA/coe-hud-acquisitions. The RFIs will be open for comment until noon EDT on Friday, May 31, 2019. 

Please note these are draft RFQs and no award will be issued as a result of this market research-related function. Feedback must be submitted through the Google Forms associated with the RFIs themselves, other forms of feedback submitted through email or other forms of communication will not be accepted. 

## Questions?

We have put together a few of the most [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) that arose during previous market research efforts. Please provide any and all feedback, whether related to those questions or otherwise, through the Google Forms linked to in the links above. We cannot commit to considering anything sent to us via any other medium. Thanks for understanding!
