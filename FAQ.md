# Frequently asked questions

## Question
*Will the CoE use the Discovery BPA for these procurements?*

### Answer
While we intend for the Discovery BPA to be available to each and every Agency Partner, the focus of the Discovery BPA is to obtain services during discovery/assessment stage, which we have been calling “Phase I.” The BPA is not intended to be used for our implementation stage, which we have been calling “Phase II” at USDA, HUD, and in our communications. While we haven’t yet settled on what strategy we intend to utilize, there is a very strong chance these will be issued against existing vehicles, like IT Schedule 70, rather than a new BPA or similar approach.

## Question
*What is the anticipated period of performance for each of the 6 buys?*

### Answer
Each buy will have its own period of performance. These range from a base year with two option periods of six months each to a base year with four option periods of one year each. It will all depend on the specific needs the procurement is designed to address. Specifically, the POPs are as follows:

* Cloud Adoption - FaaS, ERM, and IDE: Twelve (12) month base period and two (2) twelve (12) month options
* Contact Center - HUDCentral Contact Center: Twelve (12) month base period and four (4) twelve (12)
month options
* Customer Experience - Build an Agency-Wide Customer Experience Capability: Twelve (12) month base period and two (2) twelve
(12) month options
* Data Analytics - OCDO and Data Governance: Six (6) month base period, two (2) twelve
(12) month options
* Data Analytics - Advanced Analytics for OCDO: Twelve (12) month base period, two (2) six (6)
month options
* Data Analytics - Data Visualization for OCDO: Twelve (12) month base period, two (2) six (6) month options

## Question
*How are these buys interrelated?*

### Answer
In section 1.4 of each solicitation, we outline how these buys are directly related with one another. However, the Government is always seeking ways in which we can break down silos, so any suggestions related to ensuring cooperation and collaboration among the CoEs is appreciated!

## Question
Will these be the only procurements for HUD Phase II?

### Answer
While we don’t anticipate any changes to the existing set of procurements, the Government reserves the right to change this position at any time.

## Question
Can I edit my answers once submitted?

### Answer
No, in order to ensure consistency during our review of the RFQ responses, we do not allow for changes to submissions, so please provide ample time to respond. We recommend doing a dry-run (ie, put in something in each answer but *do not* hit submit at the end), allowing you time to prepare your responses, as there is no ability to save your entry while you're working on it.

## Question
Do I have to submit a response to one or more RFQs if we want to participate in a future procurement?

### Answer
No, there is no such restrcition at all.

## Question
Can you share any prototypes?

### Answer
Every artifact we believe to be relevant and that we can share will be included in the relevant RFQs repository.
