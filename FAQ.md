# Frequently asked questions

## Question
*Will the CoE use the IDIQ in the previous RFI put out by NCR for these procurements?*

### Answer
No, that IDIQ is intended to potentially supplement these buys should any gaps arise in the Phase II services that are out of the scope of the awarded contracts.

## Question
*Will the CoE use the Discovery BPA for these procurements?*

### Answer
While we intend for the Discovery BPA to be available to each and every Agency Partner, the focus of the Discovery BPA is to obtain services during discovery/assessment stage, which we have been calling “Phase I.” The BPA is not intended to be used for our implementation stage, which we have been calling “Phase II” at USDA, HUD, and in our communications. While we haven’t yet settled on what strategy we intend to utilize, there is a very strong chance these will be issued against existing vehicles, like IT Schedule 70, rather than a new BPA or similar approach.

## Question
*What is the anticipated period of performance for each of the 6 buys?*

### Answer
Each buy will have its own period of performance. These range from a base year with two option periods of six months each to a base year with four option periods of one year each. It will all depend on the specific needs the procurement is designed to address. Specifically, the POPs are as follows:

* Cloud Adoption - FaaS, ERM, and IDE: Base period of 1 year, 2 option periods of 1 year each.
* Contact Center - HUDCentral Contact Center: Base period of 1 year, 4 option periods of 1 year each.
* Customer Experience - Build an Agency-Wide Customer Experience Capability: Base period of 1 year, 2 option periods of 1 year each.
* Data Analytics - OCDO and Data Governance: Base period of 1 year, 2 option periods of 1 year each.
* Data Analytics - Advanced Analytics for OCDO: Base period of 1 year, 2 option periods of 6 months each.
* Data Analytics - Data Visualization for OCDO: Base period of 1 year, 2 option periods of 6 months each.

## Question
*How are these buys interrelated?*

### Answer
In section 1.4 of each solicitation, we outline how these buys are directly related with one another. However, the Government is always seeking ways in which we can break down silos, so any suggestions related to ensuring cooperation and collaboration among the CoEs is appreciated!

## Question
What is the estimated value of each order?

### Answer
There is no estimated value, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each CoE, but we would greatly appreciate some insight into projected costs based on the outlined Level of Effort.

## Question
Will these be the only procurements for HUD Phase II?

### Answer
While we don’t anticipate any changes to the existing set of procurements, no final decisions have been made.

## Question
Can I edit my answers once submitted?

### Answer
No, in order to ensure consistency during our review of the RFI responses, we do not allow for changes to submissions, so please provide ample time to respond. We recommend doing a dry-run (ie, put in something in each answer but *do not* hit submit at the end), allowing you time to prepare your responses, as there is no ability to save your entry while you're working on it.

## Question
Do I have to submit a response to one or more RFIs if we want to participate in a future procurement?

### Answer
First, it is important to note we are currently performing market research and there is no guarantee a procurement will follow. However, if there is a follow up procurement borne out of this RFI, participation in the RFI will not be a requirement for submitting a response.

## Question
Can you share any prototypes related to the Cloud Adoption draft RFQ?

### Answer
We are happy to provide an additional artifact that would include brief description of how we created the prototypes and the technologies/tools we employed along with the posting of an actual RFQ (should we get that far). While it won't be feasible to provide the actual prototypes, we can discuss our methodology to provide a good sense of our approach. The inputs, such as basic requirements, sample data, static forms, etc., can be provided along with the descriptions.

There are two reasons we didn't share them with this RFI: First, some of these prototypes were created voluntarily (ie, unsolicited) by companies to demonstrate their capabilities or they involved the use of free trials that are now expired. Second, we aren't "sold" on any of the approaches just yet and want to make sure we don't limit solutions being submitted by contractors. In other words, we don't want our industry partners to think the Government is looking for something similar to those prototypes -- we want to review any and all approaches!
